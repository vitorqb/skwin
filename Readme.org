* Skwin

  Skwin is a very simple C program that accepts a text input, displays it into
  a gtk3 dialog window and listens to a single user keypress, returning it.

  It is a small utility function I use when I want to prove the user with
  some options he can choose with a single keystroke, and then do something else,
  but I'm calling it outside of a terminal (shell).
